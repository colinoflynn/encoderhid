Supports up to 12x Mechanical Quadrature Encoders + 12x push buttons.

Connect the 'common' of the encoder & push-button to GND. Connect the other side to the following ports, which will have internal pull-ups enabled:

Encoder Connections:
Encoder  1: A = PINA.0, B = PINA.1
Encoder  2: A = PINA.2, B = PINA.3
Encoder  3: A = PINA.4, B = PINA.5
Encoder  4: A = PINA.6, B = PINA.7
Encoder  5: A = PINB.0, B = PINB.1
Encoder  6: A = PINB.2, B = PINB.3
Encoder  7: A = PINB.4, B = PINB.5
Encoder  8: A = PINB.6, B = PINB.7
Encoder  9: A = PINC.0, B = PINC.1
Encoder 10: A = PINC.2, B = PINC.3
Encoder 11: A = PINC.4, B = PINC.5
Encoder 12: A = PINC.6, B = PINC.7

Push Button connections:
Button  1: PINE.0 
Button  2: PINE.1
Button  3: PINE.2 
Button  4: PINE.3 
Button  5: PINE.4 
Button  6: PINE.5 
Button  7: PINE.6 
Button  8: PINE.7 
Button  9: PIND.0 
Button 10: PIND.1
Button 11: PIND.2 
Button 12: PIND.3

Note that PINE.2 is also the Hardware Boot Button. You should make the 'RESET' button accessible to easily re-enter the bootloader mode. To re-enter bootloader mode then do the following:
 1. Push button connected to PINE2 & hold it (Button 3)
 2. Push & release reset button
 3. Release button connected to PINE2, unit can now be programmed with FLIP
 
Alternatively, the firmware will jump to bootloader if you hold down buttons 1 & 4 (if normally open, 2 & 3 if normally closed). But if something gets corrupted that won't work, so you might still want the reset button.

Unconnected inputs will be ignored, since they will always read as high due to internal pull-ups. So e.g. you can have just 4 encoders & 12 buttons or so forth.

Pushbuttons should be normally open.

Changes in encoders or buttons get mapped to unique key presses. I don't know what they are explcitily, just try them & see.
